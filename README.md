MARCH (a work in progress) |  Timeline rules: A Performance Based Manager 

Human centered design focuses on people, understanding that everything is a complex system with interconnected parts. 


Here we provide a elegant way of dealing with time that embodies correlations between data points.

Estimations of the conditional probability of a complete sequence of classes length T connects output vectors used to train networks under optimality criterion. 

Hidden states of neuronal groups is an operator given a pool of classes.

### LOADER 1: Local Optimum Afferent Decision Elastic/Static Returns

A new framework: Moving systems engineering.
Idempotence is crucial to designing fault tolerant systems. 
In principle,the edifice of constructing operational artifacts that instantiate data models into cohesive, platform agnostic  elements.
